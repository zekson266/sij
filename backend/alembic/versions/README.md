# Alembic Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts generated by Alembic.

## Migration Strategy

This project uses a **single initial migration** (`001_initial_complete_schema.py`) for fresh installs. This migration creates all 15 tables (core, booker, ROPA, AI) in one step, ensuring:
- No missing tables
- Clean fresh installs
- Single source of truth for schema

**Old migrations** have been archived to `archive_all_old_migrations.tar.gz` for reference.

## Usage

### Create a new migration
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### View current revision
```bash
alembic current
```

### View migration history
```bash
alembic history
```

## Important Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
- Test migrations on development database first
- Never edit existing migration files that have been applied to production
- Create new migrations for schema changes
